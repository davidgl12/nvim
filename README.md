# DaVim
My configuration for NeoVim (v0.9+)

## Install
Create nvim folder in the `~/.config` directory and clone repo there.

If nvim v0.9 is not present, you can download the [appimage](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#appimage-universal-linux-package) into the `~/.local/bin/nvim` directory

You might need to install FUSE 2 with `sudo apt install libfuse2`
